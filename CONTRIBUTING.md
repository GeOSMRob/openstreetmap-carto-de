## How to report issues or contribute code

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto
which has its own [guidelines for contribution](CONTRIBUTING-upstream.md).

So first of all please check if your issues will apply there as well and do not
report them here in this case.

We will always prefer pull-requests over issue reports as the available
manpower of this fork is very limited.  For the same reason it is usually
very easy to get pull requests merged :)

Please always include screenshots and a tile-url in issue reports.
